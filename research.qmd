## PhD Research

**Thesis**: "An Evaluation of Multi-Agency Front Door Services in England"

My doctoral research examines the implementation and effectiveness of Multi-Agency Front Door Services (MAFDs) across England using:

- **ECHILD**: Linked administrative data including National Pupil Database and Hospital Episode Statistics (2008-2022)
- **National survey**: Designed and deployed via REDCap with 73% response rate (111/152 Local Authorities)
- **Text mining**: Web scraped and analysed 3,000+ Ofsted reports (2004-2023) to identify MAFDs implementation dates
- **Quasi-experimental methods**: Difference-in-Differences, Synthetic controls
